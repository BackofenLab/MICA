This probe contains intra-anual wood density data of a Douglas-fir tree rings (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) grown in southwestern Germany for the year 2000.

The data was measured in 8 radial directions and shows the variations of tree growth along the circumference of a tree.

To derive a representative consensus profile that well reflects all measured profiles, a prior alignment of the curves is needed, which can be done with MICA.

You can directly load the CSV file with MICA and investigate the effects of different parameterizations etc.

This example very well demonstrates the need of alignment when deriving a representative consensus profile.
The consensus of the length-normalized input curves only shows a single peak while all input curves show two significant peaks. Thus the common signal (2 peaks) is completely lost.
In contrast, when representative consensus of the MICA aligned curves features both peaks, as you can see when loading with MICA.
