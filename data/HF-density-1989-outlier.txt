This probe contains intra-anual wood density data of a Douglas-fir tree rings (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) grown in southwestern Germany for the year 1989.

The data was measured in 8 radial directions and shows the variations of tree growth along the circumference of a tree.

To derive a representative consensus profile that well reflects all measured profiles, a prior alignment of the curves is needed, which can be done with MICA.

You can directly load the CSV file with MICA and investigate the effects of different parameterizations etc.

One of the profiles (probe_8) shows a strong outlier characteristic, which complicates its alignment to the remaining data set. 
Depending on the parameterization, this strongly influences the final shape of the overall representative consensus profile, as you can see when loading into MICA.
