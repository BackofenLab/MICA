This probe contains intra-anual wood density data of a Douglas-fir tree rings (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) grown in southwestern Germany for the year 1976.

The data was measured in 7 radial directions and shows the variations of tree growth along the circumference of a tree.

To derive a representative consensus profile that well reflects all measured profiles, a prior alignment of the curves is needed, which can be done with MICA.

You can directly load the CSV file with MICA and investigate the effects of different parameterizations etc.
